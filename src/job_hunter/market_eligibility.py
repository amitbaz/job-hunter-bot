"""Conservative pre-Gemini market eligibility checks.

This module only rejects a job when a market's policy is *explicitly*
contradicted by the posting (disallowed required language, salary clearly
below the market floor, sponsorship explicitly unavailable where required,
a non-permanent employment type, or an Israel role that is explicitly
onsite/hybrid/location-bound). Anything the posting simply omits is kept and
marked "unknown" rather than rejected -- this stage exists to save Gemini
requests on unambiguous incompatibilities, not to make nuanced calls.
